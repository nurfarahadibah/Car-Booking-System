# üöó Vehicle Booking System

## 1. System Introduction

### 1.1 System Overview
The **Vehicle Booking System** is designed to simplify vehicle reservations for customers while ensuring that administrators manage the vehicle inventory efficiently. It is organized around two primary user roles: **customers** and **administrators**.

- **Customers** can quickly book vehicles, view their reservation history, search for bookings, modify or cancel reservations, and keep their profiles up to date.
- **Admins** have a toolkit for efficiently managing vehicle inventory, processing bookings, and diving into a dashboard packed with helpful information.

### 1.2 System Users
- **Customer**: Customers are the primary users of the system who interact with the reservation functionalities, view their booking history, and manage their profiles.
- **Admin**: Admins have access to functions that involve vehicle management, booking approval, and a dashboard providing an overview of the vehicle inventory and booking information.
